# üîç Maud
A small Electron app that displays frame data from the [Watson](https://github.com/TailorDev/Watson) timetracking CLI tool.

* Directly loads latest Watson data from frames file (No need to export as .csv or similar)
* Displays overview of tracked frames - including accumulated time and a GitHub-like calendar heatmap
* Per-project view - lists all frames for a respective project with date, duration and associated tags
* [Not yet implemented] Date picker to narrow display to a specific timeframe (week, month, last year etc.)

## About this Project

This tool was made as a personal project for getting a better handle on my worktime. I'm publishing this in the hope that it can be helpful to others in their personal and non-personal projects.

While Maud is usable, it is still in a pretty early and rough state. You might encounter bugs or oddities.

I don't have a concrete development goal or planned feature list, so I will be updating this app as I encounter needs or issues and whenever I have the time. But please have a look at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mistress-of-loft-and-spire/maud/issues) for things I'm thinking about. Feel free to suggest ideas or report bugs there!

The name is inspired by [Maud West](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29519806/british-capital-boasts-feminine/), a London-based private detective that lived from 1880 - 1964 and was famous for donning genderbending disguises during their investigations.

Also inspired by:

* [Watson](https://tailordev.github.io/Watson/) (being it is what this tool was based upon)
* [Crick](https://github.com/TailorDev/crick) (Unfortunately no longer available - also server-based, which I don't like)
